# StringArt
Hello all!
This repo is a project for research aroung String Art generation algorithms.

Now in the repo two algorithm sketches:
1. Typical greedy algorithm (without Brezenkhem for line calculation)
2. Genetic algorithm

Before digging into the code I recommend you to watch video with good enough problem statement

Face recognition lib data "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" could be downloaded here:
https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

P.S. This repo code is totally free to use
